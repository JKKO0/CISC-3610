Use the Wick Editor to create a project with 3 (or more if you like) frames to select from.

Create a menu of items to select and have this menu appear across all your frames.

When the user selects the item, gotoAndStop on the frame that contains the item selected. Make sure you use frame names, rather than frame numbers when writing your code.

Have sound effects/sounds in your project. As well as images/text when presenting the items.

Save your code as a wick file and also Export your project as an Interactive HTML file.  Place both the wick file and HTML files in your portfolio.   

The audio is little bit low when you click the items so increase your volume.
